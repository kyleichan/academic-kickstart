Key points:

- I am *not* arguing that we should disregard the advice of public health organizations like the CDC, FDA, and WHO. Instead, I argue that we should try to understand how these organizations approach risk and uncertainty, and how this may bias recommendations to the public.
- Ultimately, we *should* listen to experts but also think *critically* before blindly following their advice.
- This argument is not directed at people who are anti-science. Instead, my target audience is people who generally trust public institutions but have been led to believe that if they simply wash their hands, don’t touch their face, and stay 6 feet apart, they’ve essentially done enough.
- I offer several examples of seemingly conservative recommendations by the CDC, FDA, and WHO that are actually risky in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

In normal times, public health organizations like the CDC, FDA, and WHO are conservative in interpreting novel scientific findings. This reflects the broader conservatism of the scientific community. The media or the public may jump on findings from a single study, such as ones that [claim that something causes or prevents cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/general-info/does-this-cause-cancer.html). But public health experts and the scientific community more generally modulate their views of these findings based on the quantity and quality of multiple studies.

[A single study on mice may not prove much](https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/15/in-mice-twitter-account-hype-science-reporting/). But a large number of carefully conducted studies over time that have been vetted by relevant experts may gradually yield a scientific consensus. For example, no single study proves that smoking causes cancer or that human activity causes climate change. But a preponderance of evidence accumulated across many high-quality studies has established these theories as scientific facts.

In normal times, this conservative approach is warranted. One of the most famous examples of this is the [FDA’s refusal to allow the sale of thalidomide](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/woman-who-stood-between-america-and-epidemic-birth-defects-180963165/) in the US in the early 1960s, acting against the trend among many European countries. Despite strong industry and public pressure to approve the drug, [FDA inspector Frances Kelsey](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/science/frances-oldham-kelsey-fda-doctor-who-exposed-danger-of-thalidomide-dies-at-101.html) blocked the sale of thalidomide in the US due to a lack of evidence about the drug’s safety. What appeared to be an overly conservative decision at the time later proved to be farsighted when thalidomide, which had been taken by pregnant women to reduce nausea, was found to cause severe congenital deformities.

But in the face of a pandemic, this conservative attitude toward scientific evidence can actually be risky. This is because in a pandemic there may be significant downsides to waiting for stronger scientific evidence and *not* acting.

The closest analogy is the concept of "[compassionate use](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/compassionate-use/faq-20058036)" where unproven treatments may be used on patients who are critically ill. In these cases, the risks of not using these unproven treatments — namely, death — outweigh the risks of unknown side effects.

Another related concept is the "[precautionary principle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240435/)." Originally discussed in the context of environmental policy, the precautionary principle basically says that in the face of insufficient scientific evidence, we should err on the side of assuming a new product is unsafe. In other words, we should consider new products to be “guilty until proven innocent.” Here is the exact wording from the [Rio Declaration](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=111&nr=1709&menu=35), which addresses the precautionary principle and was signed by 178 nations after a 1992 UN summit:

> In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, **lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures** to prevent environmental degradation.

We can reword this to apply the precautionary principle to a pandemic situation: a “lack of full scientific certainty” should not be used as a sufficient reason for refraining from more aggressive measures to treat and contain the pandemic. Unfortunately, this is what public health organizations sometimes do. They err on the conservative side when evaluating scientific claims, which is actually a riskier approach to public health policy.

Here are a few examples of how an overly conservative approach by public health organizations can backfire, resulting in a riskier public health recommendation.

# Aerosol Transmission and Masks

The CDC and WHO have downplayed the potential role of aerosol transmission of the coronavirus, which is [different from transmission via respiratory droplets](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/). For example, here is the exact wording from the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) regarding aerosol transmission:

> Is COVID-19 airborne?
>
> The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. **These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces.**
>
> You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands.

The certainty with which the WHO claims that aerosol transmission is not possible — indeed, the words bolded above are bolded in the original text — is surprising given the [lack of consensus among scientific experts](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00974-w) and [several ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2)[high-profile](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039446v2) [studies ](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973)that suggest possible aerosol transmission. The WHO’s interpretation of these findings is conservative from a scientific evidence standpoint but actually risky from a public health perspective. The WHO’s interpretation risks creating a false sense of security among the public where people believe that if they simply maintain 1–2 meters of distance they will be safe from infection.

The [CDC makes similar claims about transmission on its website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html):

> The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
>
> \- Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
>
> \- Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
>
> \- These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
>
> \- Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
>
> \- Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Nowhere on this page does the CDC even mention the possibility of aerosol transmission.

I believe this conservative view of scientific findings regarding aerosol transmission was one of the factors behind the [CDC](https://web.archive.org/web/20200331143006/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)’s advice against wearing masks for people without COVID-19, in addition to concerns about improper usage and a lack of masks for healthcare workers.

&nbsp;  

# Coronavirus Testing: Reliability vs. Speed

The US failed to quickly ramp up testing while other countries such as South Korea and Germany succeeded. One of the factors was differing attitudes towards risk. Public health institutions must balance between two different risks: the risk of rolling out unreliable tests and the risk of insufficient test availability. The US erred on the side of being too conservative in addressing the risk of unreliable tests, which increased the risk of insufficient test availability.

Originally, the [WHO approved and promoted the use of a coronavirus test developed in Germany](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/16/cdc-who-coronavirus-tests/). But the CDC did not believe these tests were reliable enough and [sought to create its own test](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html), which ended up [failing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html). In addition, because of concerns about reliability, the FDA restricted private labs from developing and using their own tests. Thus, the CDC and FDA’s conservative approach to testing, which focused on the risk of unreliable tests, ended up creating greater public health risks overall by severely limiting testing and leaving policymakers, healthcare workers, and the public blind to the spread of the coronavirus.

In contrast, South Korea and [Germany](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-02/private-labs-helped-germany-test-1-million-for-covid-19-virus) quickly granted private labs permission to conduct coronavirus tests, which allowed these countries to quickly scale up testing. The South Korean case is particularly instructive. [It was South Korea’s previous failure in dealing with MERS](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-south-korea-scaled-coronavirus-testing-while-the-us-fell-dangerously-behind) that helped change its view of testing risk:

> In the aftermath of a 2015 outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that killed 38 people and cratered the economy, South Korea took a hard look at what had gone wrong. Among the findings: A lack of tests had prompted people ill with the disease to traipse from hospital to hospital in search of confirmation that they had MERS, a coronavirus far more virulent than the one that causes COVID-19. Nearly half the people who got the disease were [exposed at hospitals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5840604/).
>
> Korean officials enacted a key reform, allowing the government to give near-instantaneous approval to testing systems in an emergency. Within weeks of the current outbreak in Wuhan, China, four Korean companies had manufactured tests from a World Health Organization recipe and, as a result, the country quickly had a system that could assess 10,000 people a day.

# Asymptomatic Transmission

The issue of asymptomatic transmission is more puzzling. Public health officials such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have been talking about this problem [since late January](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-members-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/). Yet some political leaders claim to not have known about this problem until recently.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who had long resisted implementing a statewide stay-at-home order, [claimed that he only recently learned of asymptomatic transmission](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/02/georgia-gov-brian-kemp-who-resisted-strict-coronavirus-measures-says-he-just-learned-it-transmitted-asymptomatically/):

> Kemp said he was “finding out that this virus is now transmitting before people see signs.”
>
> “Those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad, but we didn’t know that until the last 24 hours,” he said. He added that the state’s top doctor told him that “this is a game-changer.”

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed that he only recently learned about the significance of asymptomatic transmission. From a [recent episode of NPR’s The Brian Lehrer Show](https://www.wnyc.org/story/the-brian-lehrer-show-2020-04-03):

> Brian Lehrer: Didn’t we know weeks and months ago that asymptomatic people can spread the disease?
>
> Mayor Bill de Blasio: No. The fact is and you know I’ve been at so many of these press conferences where our top doctors from New York City address this issue and they said we just didn’t have evidence from all the global medical community that was studying this issue. There was suspicion, but there was not evidence.

A generous interpretation of de Blasio’s statement is that he followed the same conservative approach of scientific experts in interpreting studies that claimed to demonstrate asymptomatic transmission.

# What else?

These are just a few examples of how a conservative approach to interpreting scientific findings about the coronavirus can actually be risky from a public health perspective. Here are a few others we might want to watch out for:

**“6 Feet” and “72 Hours”**: Public health officials have offered concrete numbers for how to act. For example, CDC guidance recommends people maintain 6 feet of distance from each other. For the [discharge of hospitalized patients ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html)and for people who are [self-isolating at home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html), the CDC recommends waiting at least 72 hours after recovery and improvement in symptoms. But we should be aware that these are very rough recommendations. There is nothing magically protective about 6 feet of distance per se, particularly if airborne transmission is likely. The same applies for the 72-hour rule. A [forthcoming paper](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.202003-0524LE) has found that signs of viral shedding can be found up to 8 days after the resolution of symptoms, although it is unclear how infectious these patients remain.

**Pulse oximeters**: These relatively inexpensive devices commonly sold at pharmacies measure blood oxygenation levels. You clip them onto your fingertip, and they shine infrared light through your skin. [Some experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/well/family/coronavirus-elderly-caregivers.html) have suggested using these at home for potential coronavirus patients. However, [other experts](https://www.today.com/health/pulse-oximeter-can-device-help-monitor-coronavirus-symptoms-home-t177210) have recommended [against buying one](https://qz.com/1832464/pulse-oximeters-for-coronavirus-unnecessary-but-selling-strong/) for use at home. Like the debate over the use of masks, it’s important for us to be clear about why we should or shouldn’t take some precautionary personal measures. If we shouldn’t buy masks or pulse oximeters because that would deprive healthcare workers of these valuable tools, that makes perfect sense. But if these tools do help, experts should be honest with the public while emphasizing the real reasons for refraining from using them.

Ultimately, we should listen to public health organizations and experts. But we shouldn’t just blindly follow their advice without understanding how their approach to risk might influence their recommendations to the public. Thinking more carefully about risk and uncertainty is not something we should leave to the experts but instead should be part of how we each process information about the coronavirus and more generally.
