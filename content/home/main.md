Abstract: How does state structure affect state capacity? The long-standing debate over centralization versus decentralization overlooks the broader organizational complexity of states and state bureaucracies. To address this problem, this article proposes an alternative typology of state organizational forms: nodal versus diffuse. Nodal forms concentrate decision-making power in a limited set of key actors at intermediary levels of the state hierarchy. Diffuse forms distribute decision-making power across many overlapping lines of authority. Nodal forms contribute to state capacity by combining the coordination advantages of centralization with the accountability and autonomy of decentralization, whereas diffuse forms make these processes more challenging. Empirically, this article compares two paradigmatic cases—China’s and India’s railway bureaucracies—to show how their nodal and diffuse forms, respectively, shape their ability to complete railway projects. These findings suggest that the organizational structure of state bureaucracies is an important yet underexplored factor underlying state capacity.

Abstract: China's state-owned enterprises are among the largest firms in the world, dominating key sectors of the Chinese economy and playing a major role in Chinese projects abroad through the Belt and Road Initiative. This article describes a system of “managed competition” among China's state-owned enterprises that attempts to harness the forces of competition while intervening to ensure a robust field of capable competitors. This system is implemented through a multi-level structure where parent state-owned enterprises coordinate and balance competition among a set of similarly resourced subsidiaries through the allocation of management personnel and resources. This article examines how this approach works in practice through an in-depth empirical case study of two of China's largest infrastructure construction firms: China Railway Group Limited and China Railway Construction Corporation. Understanding the internal structure and operations of China's state-owned enterprises sheds light on a crucial part of China's political economy and on China's efforts to extend its influence globally.
